# Create your SDN experience (WAN and DC end-to-end programmability on VXLANs) at packet.net

This playbook will create a Bare Metal Type 2 server at packet.net and install a whole Nuage VNS solution to try things like Zero Touch Bootstrapping and  Application Aware Routing. Install a Kubernetes Cluster with Plugin Nuage and a Stand-Alone docker server. Also, you can play segmenting traffic and using ACLs between WAN Branches and Containers on Kubernetes

Installing gateways, dns and ntp services, management and control planes in just one server with Centos7 KVM. Then what we do with this playbook is:
- Install your KVM server (named core or whatever you like) into the brand new bare metal type 2 server
- Using Plan OpenSource OVS to interconnect servers.
- Create a dns/ntp/dhcp instance.
- Nuage VSD ( management ) and a couple of VCSs (control).
- Util server to bootstrap your NSGs
- Stat to collect stats and apply Intelligence (Elastic Search)
- Two NSG-vs as head ends at the Datacenter
- Four NSG-vs as remote sites and a couple of clients behind
- Clients are using Ubuntu Desktop
- A Docker server with Nuage VRS (openvswitch)
- A Kuberntes Cluster v1.5 with Nuage VRS (openvswitch and nuage plugin for K8s)
- WebVirtMgr to manage your instances and bootstrapping process

Also, you can create different settings and save them into different folders in 'cfg' folder.
This project as two settings: 40r8 and 40r8-ext. Latter has multiple bare metals.

## Prepare your enviroment

Install docker on your laptop or any Linux server with access to Internet. You must have your Token ID, Project ID, AWS Access Key and Nuage License key at your reach.

## How to start

Create a folder in your latop/server and run the following.

```
curl -fsSL https://git.io/Nu4g31 > download.sh; chmod 755 download.sh; ./download.sh
```
This script will download some files to create your docker image.

```
docker build -t p1nrojas/pk-nuage-multi .
``` 

Let's start with the data-only-container and then with the app one.

```
docker run -d --name pk-nuage-data-only p1nrojas/pk-nuage-multi true
docker run -d -i -t --volumes-from pk-nuage-data-only --name pk-nuage-ansible  p1nrojas/pk-nuage-multi
```

Get access to a container
```
docker exec -i -t pk-nuage-ansible /bin/bash
```

You have to set now your Token ID, Project ID, and Nuage License key as follow:

```
[dev@45c85051d25c pk-nuage-multi]$ cat ~/.packet_token
HiKrLxoXOococoosjdhk1xRfza
[dev@45c85051d25c pk-nuage-multi]$ cat ~/.packet_project_id
bed437ce-6ae7-4b84-a8e0-90895ac3a12a32
[dev@45c85051d25c pk-nuage-multi]$ cat ~/.nuage_license_key

```

Get access to the project at ~/pk-sdnlab-stdalone and check your cfg folder with the settings of your lab. You don't need to modify anything.
Then, run the following to build your lab inventory and host_vars files, and create the packet server on the project you have chosen.
```
ansible-playbook -e nuage_release=5.1.1u1-docker-sdwan -e lab_domain=nuage511u1.lab -e lab_network_prefix=192.168.0 -e aws_access_key=AKIAKAKAKAKAGGHHXA build-packet.yml```
```

And finally, run the playbook (take about 60min)
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy-all.yml
```

When you're done. Just add the KVM server to you WebVirtMgr and play. Let's figure your 'core' server is using 147.88.157.133 as Public IP address. Then you have to do the follwoing to start playing. 
- Create libvirt user at "core" server at least: saslpasswd2 -a libvirt virtmgr (use the password you want)
- Connect WebVirtMgr at: http://147.88.157.133:8090
- Use credentials (webvirtmgr): admin/webvirtmgr (don't forget to change password later)
- Connect VSD at: https://147.88.157.133:8443
- Clients (Ubuntu Desktop) use nuage/nuage credentials 

You can add vsd1.sdn40r8.lab and stat.sdn40r8.lab to your /etc/hosts
To access stats from VSD you will need to accept self-signed certificate at https://stat.sdn40r8.lab:6200


## Create your organization, NSG profiles....
There is an 'extras' folder inside pk-sdnlab-stdalone folder (playbook directory) that you can use to set up your test domains:
```
cd extras
python vsd_script.py
```

## Some playbook can be used to reset some part of the setup

```
# destroy your ovs  bridges
ansible-playbook -i hosts ovs-reset.yml
# destroy all your KVM domains
ansible-playbook -i hosts reset-all-domains.yml
```
## Set your Kubernetes cluster

Use the inventory in 'extras' folder: 'k8s-hosts-inventory' 
And execute playbook on other folder from 'https://github.com/p1nrojas/ansible-kubeadm-nuage'
